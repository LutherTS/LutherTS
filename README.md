### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I just learned to code and I'm pretty proud of my accomplishments so far. Check out the Wagon Quest game I worked with Thomas and Paryssa as the lead back-end developer via Ruby on Rails (thanks to the support of CÃ©cile Veneziani). 

You can find me on LinkedIn and also find my one-page rÃ©sumÃ© on Canva. (Disponibles en franÃ§ais.)
