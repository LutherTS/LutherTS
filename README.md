### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I just learned to code and I'm pretty proud of my accomplishments so far. Check out the [Wagon Quest](https://www.wagon-quest.xyz/) game I worked and still work on with [Thomas](https://github.com/Tomalexis) and [Paryssa](https://github.com/Paryssatis) as the lead back-end developer via Ruby on Rails (thanks to the support of [CÃ©cile Veneziani](https://github.com/cveneziani)). 

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luther-tchofo-safo/) and also find my one-page rÃ©sumÃ© on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFMX5nAK8o/3edY3C531sOeN50ekk-F9g/view). (Disponibles en franÃ§ais.)
