### Hi there üëãüèø

I've been learning the fundamentals of web development and I'm pretty proud of my accomplishments so far. Check out the [Wagon Quest](https://www.wagon-quest.xyz/) game I worked on with [Thomas](https://github.com/Tomalexis) and [Paryssa](https://github.com/Paryssatis) as the lead backend developer via Ruby on Rails (thanks to the support of [C√©cile Veneziani](https://github.com/cveneziani)).

Nowadays, I work in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js and deploy on Vercel. So I'd recommend looking into my new demo [Grevents (starting)](https://grevents-starting.vercel.app/) made with the aforementioned stack. (Special shoutout to PostgreSQL too via Vercel Postgres. The Frontend Cloud is truly in the making.)

And now I've remade the app functional complete with authentication using Remix, Prisma and Docker via Fly.io. Feel free to use [Grevents (mixing)](https://grevents.net/). Unless I've changed it with one click for some reason, you can connect with me there via the following friend code: 6YRti3Ytysye.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luther-tchofo-safo/) and also find my one-page r√©sum√© on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFMX5nAK8o/3edY3C531sOeN50ekk-F9g/view). ‚úçüèø
