### Hi there 👋🏿

I've been learning the fundamentals of web development and I'm pretty proud of my accomplishments so far. Check out the [Wagon Quest](https://www.wagon-quest.xyz/) game I worked on with [Thomas](https://github.com/Tomalexis) and [Paryssa](https://github.com/Paryssatis) as the lead backend developer via Ruby on Rails (thanks to the support of [Cécile Veneziani](https://github.com/cveneziani)).

Later on, I've been working in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js and deploying on Vercel. So I'd recommend looking into my new demo [Grevents (starting)](https://grevents-starting.vercel.app/) made with the aforementioned stack.

I've then remade the app functional complete with authentication using Remix, Prisma and Docker via Fly.io. Feel free to use [Grevents (mixing)](https://grevents.net/). Unless I've changed this in one click for some reason, you can connect with me there via the following friend code: 6YRti3Ytysye.

And now, I'm a specialist on Next.js 15 and React 19, with my first talk at React Paris Meetup under my belt in the offices of Algolia.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luther-tchofo-safo/) and also find my one-page résumé on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF-nN7-ERI/gWpMNadwSpILzEa86Hswzw/view). ✍🏿
